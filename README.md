# PlayBackSwitcher
A shortcut to switch between headphones and speakers (Tested in win11. If you often need to switch between watching videos and fps games just like me, I highly recommend you try this script).

# Requirements
This script relies on the Set-AudioDevice and Get-AudioDevice commands, which come from the AudioDeviceCmdlets module. If you don't have this module installed yet, you need to download and install it first.
1. Open Powershell (run as administrator).
2. Run
```
Install-Module AudioDeviceCmdlets
```
