# PlayBackSwitcher
A shortcut to switch between headphones and speakers (Tested in win11. If you often need to switch between watching videos and fps games, and you are too lazy to manually click the bottom right corner to switch, it is highly recommended to try this script).

Now it's a loop switch, modify as needed.

# Requirements
This script relies on the Set-AudioDevice and Get-AudioDevice commands, which come from the AudioDeviceCmdlets module. If you don't have this module installed yet, you need to download and install it first.
1. Open Powershell (run as administrator).
2. Run
```
Install-Module AudioDeviceCmdlets
```
